# Network Delay Time Application 

The Network Delay application is implemented using the Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path
between network poles. The aim is to reduce the cost of transmitting data between the network poles
or towers of the telecommunication companies like MTN, Airtel, Vodafone, etc. 
The application help improve the network latency for telecommunication companies while sending signals
from one cell tower to another.
The concept of Dijkstra algorithm is used in achieving this aim. However, to make the application user-friendly and ready-use, we
used Streamlit python package to visualize the application.

## Project Dependencies
To successfully run this app run this application, you need to download and install Anaconda on your machine. 
After that, install the following packages
1. PIL
2. streamlit_lottie
3. csv
4. streamlit (version  1.8.1)
5. os
6. sys
7. request
8. pandas.

We have included a requirement file to assist you install all dependencies. To install all dependencies, run the command below
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Despite the fact that you will install these packages, there are a higher likelihood of facing the following technical challenges;
1. Network connection error
2. Sometimes the application takes a longer time to generate the shortest path or doesn't show the path after inserting your data.
    To solve that issue, ensure you read the information on the application  page to ensure you are doing it right and reload the app and try again.


After installing these packages, you will need to launch anaconda prompt to run and run the command below
### `streamlit run app.py`


# Beneficiaries of the Network Delay Time Application
The application is beneficiary to the telecommunication companies and their customers because
the telecommunication companies will be able to identify the shortest and the cheapest path for 
data transmission. Therefore, customers will be able to access quality services.
